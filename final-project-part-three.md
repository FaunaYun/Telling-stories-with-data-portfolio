## References
> You should have already included detailed references on your Shorthand story - if so, you can probably skip this section.  Use this section to capture any additional special notes or information necessary.  If you do this, you probably want to include a link from Shorthand to this page.

What were you most excited about?  Include any final reflections as you think they might help us understand your process.  If you already included such reflections elsewhere, you can delete this section.
