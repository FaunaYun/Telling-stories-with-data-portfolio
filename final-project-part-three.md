# Changes made since Part II
> Include few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II. 

Transitioning from part 2 to part 3, The main change I've made is still to allow for the addition of more explanatory text for each dashboard to help the audience understand more about the data and also the background context. For housing and neighborhood overview dashboards, I've added some concluding bullet points on the side to highlight a few key characteristics. For the correlation matrix, I've summarized the findings from the matrix about the correlations and how to interpret them in the context of social mobility. To validate the conclusions from the correlation matrix, I've added some graphs to explore further the possible relationships between some variables, such as household income and education level of house occupants, as it might indirectly support the correlation between education level and house value. 

Meanwhile, I also improved some visual elements, such as making the color pallet more harmonious and adding reference lines to make the visual features stand out. To make this visualization tool easier to read and use, I've added content with some specifications on each dashboard in front of all the dashboards. Also, I added a 'call to action' and two pictures on the last page to finalize and conclude the whole data visualization story.

## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

The final audience I chose is policymakers and urban researchers as 
housing is one of the most crucial indicators and drivers of social mobility, serving as a mirror of existing social inequalities. For policymakers, understanding the intricate relationships between housing conditions, demographic factors, and neighborhood quality is essential for developing effective policies that promote equitable access to quality housing. For researchers, these patterns offer valuable insights into how housing intersects with education, income, and citizenship status to shape mobility outcomes. By examining how housing conditions correlate with various social and economic factors, this analysis aims to inform both practical policy solutions and theoretical frameworks for understanding social mobility. 

In order to make these people understand more about this data story, I've added more explanatory text and concluding 'Call to action' to suggest the direction for feature policy making.

# Final thoughts
I think the most important part throughout the whole process is to think about what your target audience would like to see and what crucial information they need to improve their decision making process.
