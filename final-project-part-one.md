# Part I : Social Mobility and Housing Inequality in California's Major Metropolitan Areas
 
In the complex tapestry of social mobility, housing stands as both a mirror reflecting societal inequalities and a mechanism for generational advancement. The American Housing Survey data offers a unique window into this dynamic, revealing how housing conditions intersect with educational attainment, citizenship status, and economic opportunity. 

I picked two regions, Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim and San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, representing California's largest urban centers, showcase distinct patterns in how housing quality, neighborhood characteristics, and resident satisfaction vary across different social groups. As cities grapple with questions of equity and opportunity, understanding these housing patterns becomes crucial for identifying pathways to upward mobility. 

The analysis might reveal a nuanced story where factors such as education level and citizenship status not only correlate with housing quality but also interact with regional characteristics to create diverse mobility trajectories. By examining variables ranging from basic housing adequacy to neighborhood satisfaction, this study illuminates how housing conditions serve as both indicators and determinants of social mobility, offering insights into the complex relationship between residential circumstances and socioeconomic advancement in contemporary urban California.

I created some initial visualization for AHS 2021 data with R and will further develop with more years' of data and polish with Tableau and other visualization tools.

| American Housing Survey     | https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ahs/data.html?text-list-0ff840ba34%3Atab=2023#text-list-0ff840ba34    |  The American Housing Survey (AHS) is sponsored by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The survey has been the most comprehensive national housing survey in the United States since its inception in 1973, providing current information on the size, composition, and quality of the nationâ€™s housing and measuring changes in our housing stock as it ages. The AHS is a longitudinal housing unit survey conducted biennially in odd-numbered years, with samples redrawn in 1985 and 2015 .The survey provides up-to-date information about the quality and cost of housing in the United States and major metropolitan areas. The survey also includes questions about: the physical condition of homes and neighborhoods,the costs of financing and maintaining homes, and the characteristics of people who live in these homes. Planners, policy makers, and community stakeholders use the results of the AHS to assess the housing needs of communities and the country.  These statistics inform decisions that affect the housing opportunities for people of all income levels, ages, and racial and ethnic groups.           |
