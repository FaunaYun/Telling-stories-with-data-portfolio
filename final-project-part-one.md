# Part I : Social Mobility and Housing Inequality in California's Major Metropolitan Areas
 
In the complex tapestry of social mobility, housing stands as both a mirror reflecting societal inequalities and a mechanism for generational advancement. The American Housing Survey data offers a unique window into this dynamic, revealing how housing conditions intersect with educational attainment, citizenship status, and economic opportunity. 

I picked two regions, Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim and San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, representing California's largest urban centers, showcase distinct patterns in how housing quality, neighborhood characteristics, and resident satisfaction vary across different social groups. As cities grapple with questions of equity and opportunity, understanding these housing patterns becomes crucial for identifying pathways to upward mobility. 

The analysis might reveal a nuanced story where factors such as education level and citizenship status not only correlate with housing quality but also interact with regional characteristics to create diverse mobility trajectories. By examining variables ranging from basic housing adequacy to neighborhood satisfaction, this study illuminates how housing conditions serve as both indicators and determinants of social mobility, offering insights into the complex relationship between residential circumstances and socioeconomic advancement in contemporary urban California.
