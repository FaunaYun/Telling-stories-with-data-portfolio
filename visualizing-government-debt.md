# Assignment: Visualizing government debt using Tableau
Text here!

_As before, this template provides some of the structure you should have for your assignment, but the official instructions and guidance can be found on Canvas.  Make sure to reference that for detailed instructions on what you need to do and what you need to submit to get credit._

## Part one: Working with web-based visualization tools and data

online visualization: https://www.oecd.org/en/data/indicators/general-government-debt.html

I selected the 2022 as the single year for governments debt-to-GDP ratio graph, which shows the gross government debt as a percentage of GDP of various countries in 2022. The countries are listed along the horizontal axis, while the vertical axis represents the percentage of GDP. Japan has the highest debt ratio.

## Working with Tableau

_A reminder that to get the Tableau visualization to render correctly on Github, you'll have to do a bit of editing of the code block once you paste it here.  As before, make sure to walk us through what you did in Tableau, and any thoughts or observations, etc._

## Part three: create your own visualization

_Create another data visualization using the same data used earlier. DO NOT submit something that's just a minor modification of one of the visualizations already covered here. So, don't just modify the colors or labels of one of the earlier examples and call it good, or submit a slightly modified bar chart.  Instead, see what you can come up with on your own, and spend some time to try and create something that tells a story about the data._

_Summarize in a paragraph or two about the different methods of visualization, and how they compare / contrast to one another. Make sure you include all source information and explain the data well.  Talk about why you chose the third data visualization.  Be specific - keep your writeup relevant to the assignment, and avoid jargon-filled language that doesn't say anything useful._

_It's a good idea to go back and review your work.  Could someone follow your process and understand what you did?  Do you need to further connect any of the sections with a bit of text?  Is it something you'd be happy to have as an example of your work from the class?_
