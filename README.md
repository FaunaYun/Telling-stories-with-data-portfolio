# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hi!  My name is Yun Zeng (she/her), a current 2nd year MSPPM student at CMU. I hope I can gain data visualization skills and data narratives in this class to better prepare for my future career and study.

2. Fundamental principles of visual perception and cognition
3. How to choose the most effective visualization for specific data types and messages
4. Use visualization tools more proficiently
5. Structure compelling data narratives
6. Design visualizations for different audience types and stakeholders
